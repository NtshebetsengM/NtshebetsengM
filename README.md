## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
Hi, Iâ€™m Ntshebetseng Kananelo Yamkela Mamoloi Moloi (yes, itâ€™s a mouthful, but you can call me Nana ðŸ˜‰).

Iâ€™m a passionate software developer in training with a love for building and designing interactive apps. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and finding innovative solutions through code.

Iâ€™m currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my projects are geared towards building confidence in these areas. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where youâ€™ll find projects from my coding bootcamp and a few solo endeavors. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, suggestions, and new opportunities, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
