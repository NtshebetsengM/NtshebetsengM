## Hello World :v:
My name is Ntshebetseng Kananelo Yamkela Mamoloi Moloi (yes, it’s a mouthful—feel free to call me Nana! :wink:).

I’m a passionate software developer in training with a love for creating interactive and engaging web apps. Currently, I'm focused on mastering **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React** and **C#** while honing my problem-solving and project-building skills.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you’ll find projects from my coding bootcamp and a few solo endeavors. I’m always open to feedback, suggestions, and new opportunities, so don’t hesitate to reach out!

### More about me
I love getting lost in sci-fi and fantasy novels, where I can explore fantastical worlds and embark on epic adventures. When I’m not buried in a book, you’ll often find me enjoying a wide range of music, playing with my energetic dog Yahoo, sampling new and exciting foods, or diving into immersive video games. For me, life is richer with a compelling story, great tunes, a loyal furry friend, and an engaging gaming experience. Each of these passions adds a unique flavor to my days, making every moment a little more thrilling and enjoyable.

Thanks for checking me out! 
Happy Coding :sparkles:
