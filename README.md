## Hello World :v:
My name is Ntshebetseng Kananelo Yamkela Mamoloi Moloi (yes, it’s a mouthful, but you can call me Nana :wink:).

I’m a passionate software developer in training with a love for building and designing interactive apps. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and finding innovative solutions through code.

I’m currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my projects are geared towards building confidence in these areas. I’m excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you’ll find projects from my coding bootcamp and a few solo endeavors. I’m always open to feedback, suggestions, and new opportunities, so don’t hesitate to reach out!
## My work so far!
- [Dummy portfolio](https://github.com/NtshebetsengM/Module_7R_CS20240200_WFO2407_D_Ntshebetseng-Moloi_SDF07_R)
 
  Another scrimba code along that required us to create a template portfolio website. The portfolio also links to other html pages that have further information about the 
  pieces. This helped me gain confidence in CSS and introduced me to JS.

- [Shopping list app](https://github.com/NtshebetsengM/Module_10R_CS20240200_WFO2407_D_Ntshebetseng-Moloi_SDF10_R)

   This was a result of a code along on Scrimba. It is a mobile web application that you can use to track what groceries you need to buy. When you have found what you are 
   looking for, you can delete it from the app. This project helped me dive further into the world of javascript and databases(It is linked to a firebase live database.)

### More about me
I love getting lost in sci-fi and fantasy novels, where I can explore fantastical worlds and embark on epic adventures. When I’m not buried in a book, you’ll often find me enjoying a wide range of music, playing with my energetic dog Yahoo, sampling new and exciting foods, or diving into immersive video games. For me, life is richer with a compelling story, great tunes, a loyal furry friend, and an engaging gaming experience. Each of these passions adds a unique flavor to my days, making every moment a little more thrilling and enjoyable.

Thanks for checking me out! 
Happy Coding :sparkles:
