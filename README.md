## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I am Ntshebetseng Kananelo Yamkela Mamoloi Moloi (yes, itâ€™s a mouthful, but you can call me Nana ðŸ˜‰).

Iâ€™m a passionate software developer in training with a love for building and designing interactive apps. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and finding innovative solutions through code.

Iâ€™m currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my projects are geared towards building confidence in these areas. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where youâ€™ll find projects from my coding bootcamp and a few solo endeavors. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, suggestions, and new opportunities, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

### More about me
I love getting lost in sci-fi and fantasy novels, where I can explore fantastical worlds and embark on epic adventures. When Iâ€™m not buried in a book, youâ€™ll often find me enjoying a wide range of music, playing with my energetic dog Yahoo, sampling new and exciting foods, or diving into immersive video games. For me, life is richer with a compelling story, great tunes, a loyal furry friend, and an engaging gaming experience. Each of these passions adds a unique flavor to my days, making every moment a little more thrilling and enjoyable.

Thanks for checking me out! 
Happy Codingâœ¨
